================

<!-- WARNING: THIS FILE WAS AUTOGENERATED! DO NOT EDIT! -->

This library gathers some Python code meant to be used in the labs to be
worked in Universidad Carlos III de Madrid [Machine Learning in
Healthcare](https://aplicaciones.uc3m.es/cpa/generaFicha?est=350&asig=16803&idioma=2&anio=2022)
course.

It includes the file
[generate_timeseries.py](https://github.com/manuvazquez/uc3m_ml_healthcare/blob/01f109fecad99ecda28cf05d5269901f6f4dd9a1/uc3m_ml_healthcare/generate_timeseries.py)
from [Rubanovaâ€™s
implementation](https://github.com/YuliaRubanova/latent_ode) of the
paper [Latent ODEs for Irregularly-Sampled Time
Series](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.03907) with two minor modifications:

- commented out the unnecessary line `import lib.utils as utils`

- commented out all the *matplotlib* stuff

## Install

The package is not in [PyPI](https://pypi.org) but this should do

``` sh
pip install git+https://github.com/manuvazquez/uc3m_ml_healthcare@main
```
