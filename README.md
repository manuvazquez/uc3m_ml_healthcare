The library includes the file
[generate_timeseries.py](uc3m_ml_healthcare/generate_timeseries.py) from
[Rubanova’s implementation](https://github.com/YuliaRubanova/latent_ode)
of the paper [Latent ODEs for Irregularly-Sampled Time
Series](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.03907) with two minor modifications:

- commented out the *unnecessary* line `import lib.utils as utils`

- commented out all the *matplotlib* stuff
